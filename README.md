# Detecting-Phishing-Websites

## Step by step process done in this project

• Collecting dataset containing phishing and legitimate websites from the open source platforms.
• Writing a code to extract the required features from the URL database.
• Analyzing and preprocessing the dataset by using EDA techniques.
• Divide the dataset into training and testing sets. 
• Run selected machine learning and deep neural network algorithms like SVM, Random Forest, Autoencoder on the dataset.
• Write a code for displaying the evaluation result considering accuracy metrics.
• Compare the obtained results for trained models and specify which is better.

## As there was a huge dataset we performed Feture Extraction
The following category of features are selected:
	• Address Bar based Features
	• Domain based Features
	• HTML & Javascript based Feature


The machine learning models (classification) considered to train the dataset in this notebook are:
	• Decision Tree
	• Random Forest
	• Multilayer Perceptrons
	• XGBoost
	• Autoencoder Neural Network
	• Support Vector Machines
